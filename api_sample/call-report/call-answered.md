# Call Answered

The PBX will send a report to the application server when the calling party's call is answered.

Answering call \(the called party\) and call answered \(the calling party\) coexist. In the report, the party who triggers the call will appear first.

**Report sample:**

{"action":"ANSWERED","callid":"1495706238.328","ext":{"extid":"1002"},"ext":{"extid":"1000"}}
