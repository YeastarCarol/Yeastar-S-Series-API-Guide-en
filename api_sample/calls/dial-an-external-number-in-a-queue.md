### Dial an External Number in a Queue {#dial-an-external-number-in-a-queue}

Through this interface, an outbound call made with an external number being dialed out through S-Series IPPBXâ€™s trunk can be transferred to a queue as an inbound call after it is established. Once the call is transferred, extensions in the queue will ring according to the ring strategy.

Note: need to dial from an extension with route permission and the outbound dial pattern should be matched.
